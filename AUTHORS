======================

    XZ Embedded is developed and maintained by Lasse Collin
    <lasse.collin@tukaani.org> and Jia Tan <jiat0218@gmail.com>.

    Major parts of XZ Embedded are based on code written by Igor Pavlov,
    specifically the LZMA SDK <https://7-zip.org/sdk.html>. Without this
    code, XZ Embedded wouldn't exist.
